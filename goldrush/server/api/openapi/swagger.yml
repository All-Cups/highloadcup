    # IT RALLY 2020 HighLoad Cup
    ## Usage
    - The goal is to dig up and cash out treasures to increase your balance
      as much as possible in fixed period of time (10 minutes).
    - [Optional] Use /explore to find out where treasures were buried.
    - Use /license to ensure you have valid license ID before calling /dig.
      Each /dig call will increment license's DigUsed up to DigAllowed,
      then this license will become inactive.
    - Use /dig with Depth increasing serially from 1 to 10, and sometimes you'll
      find a treasure.
    - Use /cash on each treasure found by /dig to increase your balance.
    - [Optional] You can pay for a license if you like to - this will
      decrease your balance, but paid licenses have more DigAllowed, so
      you'll have to issue less licenses.
      Each coin in the wallet returned by /cash is unique, and may be spent to get
      paid license just once.
    - [Optional] You can get your current balance and coins using /balance, and your
      current active licenses using /licenses.
